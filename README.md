## Crowds Protocol Simulation

This is an assignement from the Privacy Technologies class (Semester: Fall 2019/2020) of the Computer Science Master program of the University of Athens, Department of Informatics and Telecommunications.

The assignment & document that was included in the deliverables is in Greek, apologies. :)

### Execution

Create 3 files using the included scripts:

cor.py for the corrupted users;

create_graph.py for the graph;

usersFileCreation.py for the user file;

And execute the simulation using:

python simulate.py <graph-file> <corrupted-file> <users-file> <brokenpaths> <strategy>
